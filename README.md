# Pet Project #5
This is my pet project #5 for Stack Builders organization.
## Installation
Clone the repository to your machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonap22/ts-retrieve-data-git-app.git
```
Then use the node package manager (npm) to install all the dependencies from the package.json file
```bash
npm i
```
## Considerations
This is a migration project from the previous pet project (Pet Project #3) to TypeScript.
## New features
This project adds the following features:
* List of top 5 repositories with more stars
* List all repositories alphabetically and remove all repositories that start with "h"
